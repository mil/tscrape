tscrape
-------

Twitter feed HTML scraper.

It scrapes HTML from stdin and outputs it to a TAB-separated format that can be
easier parsed with various (UNIX) tools. There are formatting programs included
to convert this TAB-separated format to various other formats. There are also
some programs and scripts included to import and export OPML and to fetch,
filter, merge and order items.


Build and install
-----------------

$ make
# make install


Usage
-----

	curl --http1.0 -H 'User-Agent:' -s 'https://twitter.com/namehere' | tscrape

or

	ftp -o - -U '' 'https://twitter.com/namehere' 2>/dev/null | tscrape

or

	hurl 'https://twitter.com/namehere' | tscrape


Using sfeed to convert the tscrape TSV output to an Atom feed:

	hurl 'https://twitter.com/namehere' | tscrape | \
	LC_ALL=C awk 'BEGIN { OFS = FS = "\t"; }
	{
		print $1 OFS $4 OFS "https://twitter.com/" $6 "/status/" $5  \
			OFS "" OFS "" OFS $5 OFS $7 OFS "";
	}' | sfeed_atom


Why
---

Twitter removed the functionality to follow users using a RSS feed without
authenticating or using their API. With this program you can format tweets in
any way you like relatively anonymously.
